# 🧪 **arlib.h**

> **arlib.h** is a small personal C library I built during my **first year of learning C**.
> The purpose of this library was to understand how functions, headers, and reusable code work by implementing common utilities on my own.

It’s simple, educational, and made while learning the fundamentals of C.

## ✨ About the Library

This library contains a collection of basic:

* Mathematical utilities
* User input helper functions
* Character-related utilities
* Simple array handling logic

Everything is written from scratch as a learning exercise.

---

## 📘 Function Descriptions

### 🔢 Math Functions

* **sqr** – returns the square of a number

* **cube** – returns the cube of a number

* **add, sub, mul, divi** – perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers

* **mod** – returns the remainder of integer division

---

### ⌨️ User Input Functions

* **takeint** – displays a prompt and safely takes integer input from the user

* **takefloat** – displays a prompt and safely takes floating-point input from the user

* **takechar** – displays a prompt and takes a single character input

**Note:**
These functions display a prompt and safely take user input of the required type.
They were written to avoid repeating `printf` + `scanf` everywhere and to make beginner programs cleaner and easier to read.

---

### 🔤 Character Utility

* **asciitoc** – converts an ASCII value into its corresponding character

---

### 📊 Array Utility

* **arr** – performs a basic operation on an integer array, mainly used to practice array traversal and pointer handling

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This

* To understand how C libraries are structured
* To practice writing reusable functions
* To reduce repeated code in beginner programs
* To learn C by building instead of just reading

This library represents my early learning stage — not perfect, but functional and educational.

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

* Written with a learning-first mindset
* Focused on clarity over optimization
* Easy to extend as skills improve

`arlib.h` is not meant to replace standard libraries — it exists to show progress and understanding.
